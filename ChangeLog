         - Makefile.am: simscan.o needs to depend on config.h
         - new --enable-custom-smtp-reject option to return an smtp reject

10/05/04 Version 1.0.5 (devel)
         Jeremy Kitchen
	 - fixed bug in Makefile.am, thanks Bastiaan van der Put.
	 - fixed clamdscan exit code handling.  *smacks Ken* :)
	 - changed check_scan to not close fd 1 and 2
         - changed installation a little more.
	 - switching to CVS tree to make life easier.

10/04/04 Version 1.0.4 (devel)
         Jeremy Kitchen
         - changed Makefile.am to set proper permissions on simscan binary
         - changed configure.in to better test for the simscan user
         - added support for command line changing of simscan user 
           --enable-user=<user>
         - changed Makefile.am to set the mode on the working directory to 700


09/14/04 Version 1.0.4 (devel)
         Ken Jones / Jeremy Kitchen
         - print to stderr when virus detected with IP address

         Suggested by Rick Macdougall coded by Ken Jones
         - make unique file names for the message, to/from headers and the
           optional spamassassin output. These files get unlinked before
           exec'ing the --enable-qmail-queue=PATH program. Configure defaults
           this value to the real qmail-queue program. 
               data          file name
             ____________   _______________
             message fd 0 = msg.X.Y.Z          where X = unix seconds
             to/from fd 1 = addr.X.Y.Z               Y = microseconds
             spamassassin = spamc.msg.X.Y.Z          Z = simscan process id
            fd 0 and fd 1 normally come from the qmail smtp daemon.

            Simcan can optionally be turned on or off for different 
            incoming IP ranges using the standard tcp.smtp.cdb file 
            used by tcpserver/qmail-smtpd with the -x option.

         - spam-hits was checking only greater than the reported hits. 
           It should check for greater than or equal to.

         Ken Jones
         - updated INSTALL, README and ChangeLog documentation.

         - fstat works on pipes, so switched per-domain code to allocate
           memory for the envelope with one read and one write instead of
           a read/write per character of the envelope.

 
09/13/04 Version 1.0.3 (devel)
         Ken Jones
         - The --enable-spam option now checks for an X-Spam-Flag: YES header.
           If found it returns a permenent refusal to accept message. The error
           code translates to an SMTP 500 series message refusal.

         - The --enable-spam-hits=hit_number option combinded with the 
           --enable-spam option the perment refusal is based on the calculated
           hit: value in the X-Spam-Status: header. This option allows a
           system administrator to refuse email that has a fairly high 
           hit count from spamassassin, like 10. Email that passes through
           can then be scanned again with a users personal perferences.

09/11/04 Version 1.0.2 (devel)
         Ken Jones
         - Enable clamav or spamassassin per domain
         - new simscanmk program to build clamav or spamasassing enable lists

07/20/04 Version 1.0 (production)
         Ken Jones
         - First production version
